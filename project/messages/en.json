      "faq1Q": "How is the price calculated for different languages?",
      "faq1A": "We use a <strong>Smart Character Counter</strong> based on linguistic density. 1 minute of audio equals approximately <strong>250 characters</strong> for CJK languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), <strong>600 characters</strong> for mid-density languages (Thai, Arabic, Hindi), and <strong>1,000 characters</strong> for English and Latin-based languages. This ensures fair and accurate pricing across all languages.",
      "faq2Q": "What is your revision policy?",
      "faq2A": "All tiers include <strong>Performance Retakes</strong> — adjustments to tone, speed, and emphasis at no extra charge. However, <strong>Script Changes</strong> (adding, removing, or rewriting words after recording has started) are considered a new scope and will incur an additional script-change fee.",
      "faq3Q": "What if the AI mispronounces my technical terms?",
      "faq3A": "Our <strong>Director's Cut</strong> tier includes human oversight. If the AI engine fails on a specific term, we activate a process called <strong>\"Micro-Patching\"</strong> — the original voice actor records that exact word or phrase live, which is then seamlessly spliced into the final audio for 100% pronunciation accuracy.",
      "faq4Q": "Does the price include commercial usage rights?",
      "faq4A": "Yes! Unlike traditional agencies that charge extra for licensing, <strong>all Onyx Voiceover tiers include Standard Commercial Rights by default</strong>. You can use the audio for social media, corporate videos, podcasts, and web content — forever, with no recurring fees. <em>(For national TV or Radio broadcast rights, please <contact>contact us</contact> for a Broadcast License upgrade.)</em>",
      "faq5Q": "Can I control the pacing and emotion of the AI voice?",
      "faq5A": "For <strong>AI Instant Voice</strong>, pacing and emotion are fully automated by the AI engine. For maximum creative control, we recommend our <strong>Director's Cut</strong> tier, where human directors manually adjust emphasis, breathing pauses, and emotional nuance to match your brand story perfectly.",
      "faq6Q": "What is the turnaround time?",
      "faq6A": "<strong>AI Instant Voice</strong> delivers within minutes. <strong>Director's Cut</strong> and <strong>100% Live Studio</strong> typically take <strong>24–48 hours</strong>. For scripts exceeding 10 minutes of audio, delivery times may be extended to ensure production quality.",
      "faq7Q": "Can I have multiple voices in one order?",
      "faq7A": "Each order is processed for <strong>a single voice profile</strong>. If your project requires dialogue between two or more characters, please place separate orders for each character's lines. This ensures the AI engine (or human actor) correctly applies the intended vocal characteristics to each role."

      "faq2A": "<strong>AI Curator</strong> uses our AI composition engine to generate a professional-quality track with human mixing — ideal for fast turnaround and budget-friendly projects. <strong>Pro Arrangement</strong> adds a dedicated human producer who arranges live guitar and instruments for radio-ready production quality.

All performers have legally waived their moral rights to ensure you receive unencumbered commercial usage. Onyx Studios, as the production house, retains <em>Production Credit</em> and the right to showcase the work in our professional portfolio. You may use the asset commercially without attributing individual performers. This does not grant ownership of any underlying AI model or production technology.",

      "faq4Q": "Can I use the music on TV or in films?",
      "faq4A": "<strong>Pro Arrangement</strong> and <strong>Masterpiece</strong> include Broadcast TV and Film/Cinema rights. <strong>AI Curator</strong> covers YouTube, Social Media, and standard commercial use. To upgrade your license, please <contact>contact us</contact>.",
      "faq5Q": "What is the revision process, and what happens if I exceed the included rounds?",
      "faq5APart1": "<strong>AI Curator</strong> includes 2 revision rounds. <strong>Pro Arrangement</strong> includes 3 rounds. <strong>Masterpiece</strong> includes 5 complimentary rounds. A \"round\" covers all feedback provided within a single request.",
      "faq5APart2": "<strong>Beyond your included rounds</strong>: Any additional revision requests will be treated as a separate service extension. We will provide a specific quote based on the complexity of the request (e.g., minor mixing tweaks vs. significant structural changes) to ensure our production team's time is compensated fairly.",
      "faq6Q": "Am I allowed to edit the music or use it in multiple videos?",
      "faq6A": "Yes. Every Onyx license includes the <strong>Onyx Creative Freedom Clause</strong>. You have the irrevocable right to edit, re-sequence, and synchronize the audio with an unlimited number of video segments or social media posts, provided they remain within the licensed brand or project context. We do not charge additional synchronization fees for derivative works.",

      "faq7ANote": "Note: We utilize world-class virtual libraries to achieve cinematic results, but full-scale live orchestral recording is not included in standard tiers.",
      "faq8Q": "How long does delivery take?",
      "faq8A": "<strong>AI Curator</strong>: 5–7 business days. <strong>Pro Arrangement</strong>: 10–14 business days. <strong>Masterpiece</strong>: 14–21 business days. Complex projects (e.g. with live orchestral recording) may require additional time. Rush delivery is available upon request.",
      "faq9Q": "Can I request a specific genre or style?",
      "faq9A": "Absolutely. During the order process you can specify your desired genre, reference tracks, mood, and tempo. Our production team will match your creative vision. For highly specialized genres or cultural styles, we recommend the <strong>Pro Arrangement</strong> or <strong>Masterpiece</strong> tier for the best results.",
      "faq10Q": "Can I cancel my project and receive a refund once production has started?",
      "faq10A": "Due to the intensive creative labor involved, our refund policy is <strong>milestone-based</strong>. Refunds are available before production begins. Once the project enters the <strong>\"Live Recording Phase\"</strong> (meaning a human vocalist or session musician has been scheduled and recorded), the service fee becomes <strong>non-refundable</strong>.
